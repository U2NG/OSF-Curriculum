# OSF-Curriculum

This repository will hold the lesson plans for OSF curriculum development. We'll start out with one general lesson, and potentially overtime expand to more discipline specific example materials, or more optional lesson parts.

# Contributor guidelines:

We welcome and encourage community engagement on these lessons. You can put in or respond to issues that have already been created about the type and placement of content, or add/modify actual less content through pull request to the repositories. If you are unfamiliar with git/github, you can also email us at stats-consulting[at]cos.io with comments or suggestions about the material.
