# OSF-Curriculum

This repository will hold the lesson plans for OSF curriculum development. The goal of this repository is to provide materials that others can use to run OSF workshops. We'll start out with one domain agnostic general lesson, and potentially overtime expand to more discipline specific example materials. This lesson is made to be able to be taught by people from different backgrounds, scientists and librarians, so we are trying to not assume any expertise in experimental design or statistics for the main OSF lessons. However, lessons on things like pre-registration, reproducible coding, etc., may be created in the future as optional add-on lessons (see issues for a running potential list). 

# Contributor guidelines:
