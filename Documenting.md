# Documenting as you go

## Learning objectives
* Understand how to effectively document ‘during the process’
	* Uploading files
	* Version control on the OSF
* Understanding the importance of certain lifecycle points
	* Creating Registrations
	* GUIDs/DOIs

# Section Outline
* A run through registration feature (warn participants that they should not follow along with this part)
	* discuss what a registration does

A registration creates a frozen snapshot of a project, or section of a project, that can never be deleted or changed. So basically, it’s a permanent, read-only copy of that part of the project.

	* discuss it’s use cases

A registration is a way to mark important points in the life of the project so you, and perhaps others, can easily go back and see what the project looked like at that point in time. Two particularly important points in a projects life that researchers may often want to register are the point right before data collection/analysis (often referred to as a pre-registation) and when a project has been completed and you are ready to share it with others, either through a publication and/or by openly sharing the data.

	* show the steps to register a project

I am going to show how you go about registering a project. Do **not** follow along with this section, as registrations are not reversible. The first thing you’ll need to do is click on the ‘registration’ tab on the top of the project [screenshot]. Note that the registration will contain the component you are currently in, and everything downstream of that component (i.e. everything nested within the component you’re currently in). 

This will take you to a page where you will register your project. There are a few different ‘registration templates’ that you can choose from. If you are unsure, just choose the ‘Open-ended Registration’ and this will give you the ability to provide some information about why you are registering the project. This is important, as you can have multiple registrations of a project and this section will allow you to tell them apart. 



	* show and discuss embargo feature
	* register project
	* have person B on my team cancel the registration
	* ask if anyone followed along and make sure they’re registrations were canceld
* Person A uploads initial analysis script, Person B uploads data dictionary, Person C uploads data file(s)
	* Person B edits person A’s analysis script so it includes comments
	* Person C edits the wiki to update is based on the analyses that were done
