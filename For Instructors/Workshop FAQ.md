#Workshop FAQ

Below is a list of questions that have commonly come-up in past workshops. We’ve provided answers which you can use, together with the [FAQ on the OSF website](https://osf.io/faq/), to prepare for workshops. If there are questions that have commonly come up at workshops you’ve given, feel free to add them.


* **How many users does the OSF have?**
  * As of April 7th 2016, the OSF has 20,960 users.

* **What disciplines are OSF users from?**
  * We don’t have exact numbers for this, because users can tell us as much or as little about themselves as they want in their user profiles. However, anecdotal information suggests that the OSF have a strong user base in the social sciences. There are also growing user bases in the life sciences and earth sciences.

* **Is there a cap on the amount of storage I get?**
  * No, there is currently no limit on a user’s overall storage on the OSF. Individual files uploaded to OSF Storage cannot be larger than 128MB, but larger files can be connected to projects through 3rd party storage add-ons.

* **Can I add files or make changes to the wikis of registrations?**
  * No, registrations cannot be changed. If you wish to change a registration, you can either cancel the pending registration (if you are still within the 48 approval window) or you can make your changes to the project itself and create a new registration.

* **How do I know when changes have been made by other people to projects I’m on?**
  * If you are a contributor on a project, you will get an email notification when a new file is uploaded or when a comment is made. You can change your notification preferences (never, immediately, once daily) in the project’s ‘settings’ tab.

* **What is the difference between an OSF registration and a preregistration?**
  * A registration on the OSF creates a read-only snapshot of a project. The OSF registration function can be used to create a preregistration if it is done before data collection begins and contains the necessary information, such as a research questions and study protocol. The OSF registration function can also be used at other times in a project’s lifecycle. For example, you might register a project once the study is complete and has been accepted by a journal, in order to obtain a DOI for the project materials.

* **Can you share private links to projects?**
  * Yes, the OSF allows you to generate ‘view-only links’ to private projects. View-only links are created on the ‘contributors’ tab of a project. These links can grant access to an entire project or select components. You also have the option to ‘anonymize’ the link, which will remove contributor names from the project so it can be used for blinded peer review. When you are finished using a link, you can delete it to revoke access.

* **Can you register only parts of a project, for example only specific sub-components?**
  * Yes. If you only wish to register a sub-component of a project, you can go into that particular component, go to the ‘registrations’ tab and complete the registration process. This will register just that component and any components under it. 

* **Is there a way to set up a lab-group or organization on the OSF?**
  * You cannot create a lab-group or organization directly on the OSF, but you can create a project for a lab group or organization, make all the members contributors to that project, and then have the ‘link’ all projects related to the group to the lab-group project. To see an example of how this might work see this project (need to set up example). The wiki contains the instructions for how individuals would go about adding projects. This example also contains a lab project template that all lab members could use for their projects. This is a great way to ensure consistent organization/data management across lab members/projects.
