* **Pre-workshop**

  * The workshop curriculum will change overtime, as OSF features get added. Before a workshop please look over the last commit information for the 5 sections to see if anything has changed since the last time you gave a workshop.

  * One or two days before, send out a reminder email along with the [example materials](https://github.com/csoderberg/OSF-Curriculum/tree/master/Example%20Materials). You can also ask participants to sign-up for an OSF account before the start of the workshop.

* **Post-workshop**

  * Ask participants to make all demo projects/components private so as not to have a ton of demo public projects left on the site.

  * Check that everyone has canceled any registrations that were made during the workshop, just in case anyone followed along.

  * Give participants the paper version of the survey, scan them, and then email them to the COS.
