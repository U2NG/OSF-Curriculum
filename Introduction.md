# Introducing the Problem

## Learning objectives
* Understand the current issues and barrier to reproducibility
* Understand why the whole workflow is important
* Understand documentation/organizational issues underpinning this

## Section Outline
* Discuss evidence for low levels of reproducibilty

Over the past few years there has been a growing concern that many of the findings in the published literature may now replicate. 

* Why is this a problem (for individual researchers, for a lab, for others)

Low levels of reproducibility are a problem for a number of reasons. 

* What is leading to low levels of reproducibility?
	* Current workflow non-transparency
	* Current lack of workflow documentation
		* issues that can arrive with lack of transparency at all points
	* Show a real world example of ‘typical’ workflow with really bad organization
