# Introducing the Problem

## Learning objectives
* Understand the current issues and barrier to reproducibility
* Understand why the whole workflow is important
* Understand documentation/organizational issues underpinning this

## Section Outline
* Discuss evidence for low levels of reproducibilty

Over the past few years there has been a growing concern that many of the findings in the published literature may now replicate. 

* What is reproducibility?

There are a lot of different definitions out there of what ‘reproducible’ means. So before we get too far we should define out terms. 

One way in which a study can be reproducible is that if you took someones data and their code and reran exactly what they did, you would be able to reproduce the numbers they got. This is sometimes called computational reproducibility. Another type of reproducibility is the question of whether we can reproduce what was done. So, do we have enough information to rerun the experiment or survey the way it was originally done? Another type of reproducibility is the question of, if we reran the study using the same methods and the same analyses, but collected our own data, would we reproduce the results? This is often called replicability. 

Now, all these types of reproducibility are important and all have their challenges. And you’ll notice that some are dependent upon one another. So, if you don’t have experimental reproducilbity you won’t be able to gage the replicability of a study since you won’t ever be able to rerun it. Today, we’ll mostly be talking about ways to increase the computational and experimental reproducibility of studies. 

* Why is this a problem (for individual researchers, for a lab, for others)

Low levels of reproducibility are a problem for a number of reasons. 

* What is leading to low levels of reproducibility?
	* Current workflow non-transparency
	* Current lack of workflow documentation
		* issues that can arrive with lack of transparency at all points
	* Show a real world example of ‘typical’ workflow with really bad organization
