# Sharing your Work


## Learning Objectives
* Understand the motivations for open sharing
* Understand important considerations before making data public
* Understand how to make research findable	
* Understand how to get credit for your work


## Why share?

Now that we’ve created our project, uploaded all our materials, documented our entire process, we’re at the point where we need to decide if we want share our work, and if so what parts of it do we want to share? There are many different reasons why you might want to share your work. Many funder and some journals now require that data and code be shared upon publication or the conclusion of a grant. Additionally there is evidence to suggest that papers with open data get cited more than papers that do not. Finally, sharing materials and data makes it easier for others to try and reproduce your work, and potentially try to build off it. So, there are both internal and external reasons that may motivate sharing some of all of your research products. 

## Sharing

As we talked about before, everything on the OSF defaults to private. You can make either the entire project, or specific components of the project public at any point you want by clicking o the `public` button of each project/component you wish to make public. Now that we’re finished with our study, we need to decide how much we want to make public. One important thing to consider before making anything public is whether it contains anything that I can’t make public for legal or ethical reasons?’ That might include materials that you used in your project that are perhaps copyrighted, or data-files that are not anonymous and so your IRB has told you that you can only make public the anonymous dataset. 

### Activity
With your group, discuss how much of your project you want to make public. Additionally, if you have to move any files or create new components to make sure you don’t release any non-anonymized data, do that now. 


## Increasing discoverability
 
* Show search on OSF and search on SHARE

We want to make sure that when we make our work open, we also make sure it is discoverable. Work posted on the OSF can be discovered in a couple of different ways. The first is through the search function within the OSF itself. We can search for anything we want, a project title, a general topic, a person’s name, and the system will bring up anything related to our search. You’ll see it will also make suggestions about ways to potentially refine your search. Public project on the OSF are also indexed by google, so they are discoverable outside of the system. So, for example, if we go to google and search for ‘Brian Nosek replication’ two of the first things that come up are related to the OSF. Finally, the last way that information on the OSF is discoverable is through the SHARE notification service. If we go to ‘osf.io/share’, this will allow us to search through the contents of over 40 different providers. For SHARE specifically, only public registrations show up in the search results, which is another reason to register projects when you want to release a stable version of them.

* Example tags and have someone (not the same person as above) add some tags

Something to keep in mind is how to make your work more discoverable to people. Currently, the search on the OSF will search through contents in the wiki, project/component names, and tags. But it won’t search through individual files. So, if you think there are a few important key words that people might use to search for your project that don’t appear in the wiki or project name, where do you put this information? I mentioned tags. So if we go back to our projects, you’ll notice this ‘tags’ area to the right of the screen. I can put whatever descriptors or keywords in here that i want to make it easier to discover my project for searching for related words/topics. So, go ahead and add some tags that you think might be relevant to your project.


* Now that work is open and findable, how can they make sure they get credit for their work?
	* remind them of DOI feature on registrations
	* point of auto-generated citations
So a big part of academia and the job market is being able to show that your work has impact. The classic way many fields often talk about this is citation counts. Now, we know this isn’t a great metric, particularly for newer papers, but since there is still a heavy emphasis places on it, we want to make sure that whatever we make open can be cited by other people who used it. We talked before about how you can get DOIs for your work through public registrations. Every project and component on the OSF also has an automatically generated citation which uses the GUID of the page, so as long as you have the correct contributor list on your project, everyone can get credit for it.

	
	* citation counts not that great at measuring actual impact/use. What other information do we give them?
		* show statistics page of an older public project
			* also show download counts

As I mentioned, citation counts aren’t a particularly good metric, so what else is there? Well, two things we might be interested in are views and downloads. For all public projects we track how many people are visiting a page, and we track how often all files are downloaded. No, your projects aren’t particularly old, so they probably won’t have very many views. But, if we search for ‘Daniel Lakens’ and click on this project, we can see how views and downloads can give vastly different information than citation counts. So, this is an OSF project associated with an article published in Frontiers, which is an open access journal. The paper and supplemental materials were also made publicly available on the OSF. Now, last time I check, this paper has had a bit under 100 citations, which isn’t bad, but it’s not a huge amount of impact. If we click on the files tab, that will allow us to see the download coutns for all the files. You can see that the paper has been downloaded around 1500 times, which is a ton. Additionally, if we go to the statistics tab, we can see how many people are viewing the cite and where in the world they ar eviewing it from. So, these view and download numbers are telling a much more impressive story than the citations, a lot of people are interstedin this project because they find the materials useful.
