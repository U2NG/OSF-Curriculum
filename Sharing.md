## Learning Objectives
* Understand the motivations for open sharing
* Understand important considerations before making data public
* Understand how to make research findable
	* Public/Private Settings
	* How to add/use tags
	* Searching on the OSF	
* Understand how to get credit for your work
	* GUIDs/DOIs
	* Statistics Page
	* Forking

## Section Outline
* Go over different motivations for open sharing
	* funder mandates
	* increased impact of work
	* reproducibility
* Have one group member make some part or whole of the project public

So, as we mentioned before, everything on the OSF defaults to private, unless you choose to make parts or all of a particular project public. Now that we’re finished with our study, we need to decide how much we want to make public. You can do this by clicking on the ‘public’ button at the top of the project. Now one important thing to think about before you make anything public is, ‘is there anything in this component that I can’t make public for legal or ethical reasons?’ That might include materials that you used in your project that are perhaps copyrighted material that you can’t openly share, or data-files that are not anonymous and so your IRB has told you that you can only make public the anonymous dataset. So, we’re now going to have you discuss in groups what parts of your project you want to make public and then go ahead and make those sections public. If you have to make some changes to the organization of your project to allow you to make public and keep private the specific files that you need or want to, that’s fine.


* Show search on OSF and search on SHARE

We want to make sure that when we make our work open, we also make sure it is discoverable. Work posted on the OSF can be discovered in a couple of different ways. The first is through the search function within the OSF itself. We can search for anything we want, a project title, a general topic, a person’s name, and the system will bring up anything related to our search. You’ll see it will also make suggestions about ways to potentially refine your search. Public project on the OSF are also indexed by google, so they are discoverable outside of the system. So, for example, if we go to google and search for ‘Brian Nosek replication’ two of the first things that come up are related to the OSF. Finally, the last way that information on the OSF is discoverable is through the SHARE notification service. If we go to ‘osf.io/share’, this will allow us to search through the contents of over 40 different providers. For SHARE specifically, only public registrations show up in the search results, which is another reason to register projects when you want to release a stable version of them.

* Example tags and have someone (not the same person as above) add some tags

Something to keep in mind is how to make your work more discoverable to people. Currently, the search on the OSF will search through contents in the wiki, project/component names, and tags. But it won’t search through individual files. So, if you think there are a few important key words that people might use to search for your project that don’t appear in the wiki or project name, where do you put this information? I mentioned tags. So if we go back to our projects, you’ll notice this ‘tags’ area to the right of the screen. I can put whatever descriptors or keywords in here that i want to make it easier to discover my project for searching for related words/topics. So, go ahead and add some tags that you think might be relevant to your project.


* Now that work is open and findable, how can they make sure they get credit for their work?
	* remind them of DOI feature on registrations
	* point of auto-generated citations
	* citation counts not that great at measuring actual impact/use. What other information do we give them?
		* demo forking function
		* show statistics page of an older public project
			* also show download counts
* Recap of general things they’ve learned
