# Sharing your Work


## Learning Objectives
* Understand the motivations for open sharing
* Understand important considerations before making data public
* Understand how to make research findable
	* Public/Private Settings
	* How to add/use tags
	* Searching on the OSF	
* Understand how to get credit for your work
	* GUIDs/DOIs
	* Statistics Page
	* Forking

## Section Outline
* Go over different motivations for open sharing
	* funder mandates
	* increased impact of work
	* reproducibility
* Have one group member make some part or whole of the project public
* Example tags and have someone (not the same person as above) add some tags
* Show search on OSF and search on SHARE

We want to make sure that when we make our work open, we also make sure it is discoverable. Work posted on the OSF can be discovered in a couple of different ways. The first is through the search function within the OSF itself. We can search for anything we want, a project title, a general topic, a person’s name, and the system will bring up anything related to our search. You’ll see it will also make suggestions about ways to potentially refine your search. Public project on the OSF are also indexed by google, so they are discoverable outside of the system. So, for example, if we go to google and search for ‘Brian Nosek replication’ two of the first things that come up are related to the OSF. Finally, the last way that information on the OSF is discoverable is through the SHARE notification service. If we go to ‘osf.io/share’, this will allow us to search through the contents of over 40 different providers. For SHARE specifically, only public registrations show up in the search results, which is another reason to register projects when you want to release a stable version of them.

* Now that work is open and findable, how can they make sure they get credit for their work?
	* remind them of DOI feature on registrations
	* point of auto-generated citations
	* citation counts not that great at measuring actual impact/use. What other information do we give them?
		* demo forking function
		* show statistics page of an older public project
			* also show download counts
* Recap of general things they’ve learned
