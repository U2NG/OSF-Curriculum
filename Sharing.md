## Section Outline
* Go over different motivations for open sharing
	* funder mandates
	* increased impact of work
	* reproducibility
* Have one group member make some part or whole of the project public

So, as we mentioned before, everything on the OSF defaults to private, unless you choose to make parts or all of a particular project public. Now that we’re finished with our study, we need to decide how much we want to make public. You can do this by clicking on the ‘public’ button at the top of the project. Now one important thing to think about before you make anything public is, ‘is there anything in this component that I can’t make public for legal or ethical reasons?’ That might include materials that you used in your project that are perhaps copyrighted material that you can’t openly share, or data-files that are not anonymous and so your IRB has told you that you can only make public the anonymous dataset. So, we’re now going to have you discuss in groups what parts of your project you want to make public and then go ahead and make those sections public. If you have to make some changes to the organization of your project to allow you to make public and keep private the specific files that you need or want to, that’s fine.


* Show search on OSF and search on SHARE

We want to make sure that when we make our work open, we also make sure it is discoverable. Work posted on the OSF can be discovered in a couple of different ways. The first is through the search function within the OSF itself. We can search for anything we want, a project title, a general topic, a person’s name, and the system will bring up anything related to our search. You’ll see it will also make suggestions about ways to potentially refine your search. Public project on the OSF are also indexed by google, so they are discoverable outside of the system. So, for example, if we go to google and search for ‘Brian Nosek replication’ two of the first things that come up are related to the OSF. Finally, the last way that information on the OSF is discoverable is through the SHARE notification service. If we go to ‘osf.io/share’, this will allow us to search through the contents of over 40 different providers. For SHARE specifically, only public registrations show up in the search results, which is another reason to register projects when you want to release a stable version of them.

* Example tags and have someone (not the same person as above) add some tags

Something to keep in mind is how to make your work more discoverable to people. Currently, the search on the OSF will search through contents in the wiki, project/component names, and tags. But it won’t search through individual files. So, if you think there are a few important key words that people might use to search for your project that don’t appear in the wiki or project name, where do you put this information? I mentioned tags. So if we go back to our projects, you’ll notice this ‘tags’ area to the right of the screen. I can put whatever descriptors or keywords in here that i want to make it easier to discover my project for searching for related words/topics. So, go ahead and add some tags that you think might be relevant to your project.


* Now that work is open and findable, how can they make sure they get credit for their work?
	* remind them of DOI feature on registrations
	* point of auto-generated citations
So a big part of academia and the job market is being able to show that your work has impact. The classic way many fields often talk about this is citation counts. Now, we know this isn’t a great metric, particularly for newer papers, but since there is still a heavy emphasis places on it, we want to make sure that whatever we make open can be cited by other people who used it. We talked before about how you can get DOIs for your work through public registrations. Every project and component on the OSF also has an automatically generated citation which uses the GUID of the page, so as long as you have the correct contributor list on your project, everyone can get credit for it.

	
	* citation counts not that great at measuring actual impact/use. What other information do we give them?
		* show statistics page of an older public project
			* also show download counts

As I mentioned, citation counts aren’t a particularly good metric, so what else is there? Well, two things we might be interested in are views and downloads. For all public projects we track how many people are visiting a page, and we track how often all files are downloaded. No, your projects aren’t particularly old, so they probably won’t have very many views. But, if we search for ‘Daniel Lakens’ and click on this project, we can see how views and downloads can give vastly different information than citation counts. So, this is an OSF project associated with an article published in Frontiers, which is an open access journal. The paper and supplemental materials were also made publicly available on the OSF. Now, last time I check, this paper has had a bit under 100 citations, which isn’t bad, but it’s not a huge amount of impact. If we click on the files tab, that will allow us to see the download coutns for all the files. You can see that the paper has been downloaded around 1500 times, which is a ton. Additionally, if we go to the statistics tab, we can see how many people are viewing the cite and where in the world they ar eviewing it from. So, these view and download numbers are telling a much more impressive story than the citations, a lot of people are interstedin this project because they find the materials useful.
