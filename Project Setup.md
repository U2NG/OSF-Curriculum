Setting up a collaborative space
Learning objectives
Understand the purpose and use of the wiki
Create initial project description (wiki)
Understand use and importance of subfolder/subcomponent organization
Add components to a project
Understand how to set up a centralizer location for project storage/management
Add collaborators to project
Connect an add-on to the OSF (github)
Section Outline
Set up study example & break room into ‘collaborative groups’ for project creation
Example should be pretty simple dataset that is easily accessible to all
perhaps the ‘gapminder’ data set that is used by other groups (e.g. SWC) and has some country level data
cut down dataset and materials to work for our needs
3 person groups, each working on creating one OSF project for the three of them
Describe what a ‘project’ on the OSF can be and create one for example
Project can be a: Lab group, organization, grant, line of research, individual study;
it’s basically the top level of nesting, you can nest as many things under it as you like
Person A create a project for the group
Orient attendees to the project overview page (title, wiki, file tree, privacy setting, GUID)
describe and point out main features/state of project upon creation
Project page has GUID that you can use to direct others to the project
have person B try the link, see that they can’t see it
Project default to privates so only collaborators can see it
File tree: place where you can upload basically any type of file, with size limit
we’ll go over ways to give structure to this area and to deal with size limits later on
Set up collaborative space
Person A adds people B & C to the project as contributors
note contributor permissions & non-bibliographic options
point out autogenerated citation which now has all collaborators
Commenting functionality
have participants discuss using comments what they want their research question to be
Create a wiki
Person B starts, person A & C add content 
research question & hypothesis to start out with
Add structure to the project
Explain components vs. folders and demo making one versus the other
components have all the same functionality as projects (wikis, their own contributor settings, their own public/project settings)
folders are just ways to organize files, have no other functionality
Have participants collectively create structure for their project however they like
Have someone connect and add-on (github or dropbox)
other participants make edits to content in those add-ons
